# vagrant-xdata
DARPA XData Vagrant VM

Please make sure that vbguest is installed (https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest/).  
It helps keep the VirtuaalBoxGuestAdditions up to date.

When starting this on Linux, do not use your distribution's Vagrant package to install vagrant. Install from Vagrantup.com to ensure you're using the latest version of Vagrant. Using old versions of Vagrant will result in errors.
